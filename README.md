Database Systems Project modeling the Indian Railway Enquiry/Reservation System

Features include:

* Ability to look up trains and their schedules by train name
* Learn about the various trains running between two stations
* Look for new places to visit around the country
* Keep tabs on your current, and cancelled, reservations

This app uses an sqlite database and the FMDB wrapper classes to perform database operations.
It also has a raw query system hidden inside for access to the database (mandatory for project evaluation).
